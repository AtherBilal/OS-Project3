The user process is "child" instead of "user".

To run this program in the root directory run the following commands

```
make
cd bin
./oss -s X -l Y -t Z
```
Where X is the max processes to be run at any time (Defaul)
Where Y is the path to the log file. (must be readable)
Where Z is the number of seconds to time the process out

to see commits you can run 
`cat .gitlog`


NOTE: There is an issue at the end where the there is an error from the child 
`child: Error: Invalid argument`
This is caused by a bug where (I suspect) the shared memory is being deallocated from master before the child is able to detach from it.
Also for a similar reason the last child may be orphaned as a result.
